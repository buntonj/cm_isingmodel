# cm_isingmodel

This repository is an undergraduate project that simulates the ferromagnetic properties of Iron atoms in an $n\times n\times n$ 3D lattice.  The simulation uses an Ising model, simulated using a Metropolis-Hastings (or Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo) technique with a random walk proposal function.
